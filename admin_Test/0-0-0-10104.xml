If, however, the commissioner of finance in his or her discretion believes that any such transferee or transferor subject to the provisions of this chapter is about to cease business, leave the state or remove or dissipate the assets out of which the tax or penalty might be satisfied, and that any such tax or penalty will not be paid when due, the commissioner may declare such tax or penalty to be immediately due and payable and may issue a warrant immediately. b. As an additional or alternate remedy, the commissioner of finance may issue a warrant, directed to the city sheriff commanding the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the transferee or transferor or other person liable for the tax which may be found within the city, for the payment of the amount thereof, with any penalty and interest, and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return such warrant to the commissioner of finance and to pay to the commissioner the money collected by virtue thereof within sixty days after the receipt of such warrant. The city sheriff shall within five days after the receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy thereof, and thereupon such clerk shall enter in the judgment docket the name of the person mentioned in the warrant and the amount of the tax, penalty and interest for which the warrant is issued and the date when such copy is filed. Thereupon the amount of such warrant so docketed shall become a lien upon the title to and the interest in real and personal property of the person against whom the warrant is issued. The city sheriff shall then proceed upon the warrant in the same manner, and with like effect, as that provided by law in respect to executions issued against property upon judgments of a court of record and for services in executing the warrant the sheriff shall be entitled to the same fees, which he or she may collect in the same manner. In the discretion of the commissioner of finance a warrant of like terms, force and effect may be issued and directed to an officer or employee of the department of finance, and in the execution thereof such officer or employee shall have all the powers conferred by law upon sheriffs, but shall be entitled to no fee or compensation in excess of the actual expenses paid in the performance of such duty. If a warrant is returned not satisfied in full, the commissioner of finance may from time to time issue new warrants and shall also have the same remedies to enforce the amount due thereunder as if the city had recovered judgment therefor and execution thereon had been returned unsatisfied.</PARA>
